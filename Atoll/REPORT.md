The project completes necessary calculations and returns the total distance between locations for travel from South to North and from West to East. The only thing I did not implement was handling comparisons between a location that is slightly further south than another. For example, If we had two locations with Latitude degree 41, my program will not successfully put them in order based on their minute and second values. This is a problem that does not come up in this project. It does put all other values in their correct order.
